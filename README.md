# sudoku.ts

Modern TypeScript Sudoku library with advanced hint detection

This library provides a complete sudoku solving and generation system with:

- **Core solving**: Fast constraint propagation and backtracking solver
- **Puzzle generation**: Creates puzzles of varying difficulty levels
- **Advanced hints**: Detects solving techniques from basic singles to advanced sets
- **Type safety**: Full TypeScript support with comprehensive type definitions
- **Modern architecture**: Clean, modular design with focused responsibilities

The library is originally inspired by Peter Norvig's solver but has been completely
rewritten in modern TypeScript with significant enhancements.
